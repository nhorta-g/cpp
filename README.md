# CPP-Module-00 | 42 Lisbon

## Introduction

This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things *will* start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

## Installation

For this project and fututre C++ projects it is only required to have `clang` and/or `gcc`, which provide their respective compilers `clang++` and `g++`. It is also recommended to install the `valgrind` package on **Linux** for debugging purposes. Every exercise (unless specified otherwise) includes its own Makefile with the necessary instructions.

## Summary
For a first module, it was mostly easy, except for *ex02*, which was a bit tricky to understand at first.
