# CPP-Module-00 | 42 Lisbon

### Table of Contents

## Introduction

This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things *will* start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

## ex00. Megaphone

This first exercise is quite simple, we are asked to create a program that takes arguments and prints them back to the terminal in capital letters. If no arguments are provided the program will print out a default message, also in captial letters.

### Example

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/189324945-b80fb99d-3b0a-4986-9e1c-1529fa5b47f7.png">
</div>

## ex01. My Awesome PhoneBook

This second exercise is a bit more fun. We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can **ADD** or **SEARCH** for contacts, and we can also **EXIT**, clearing the list of contacts and ending the program. The phonebook can receive up to 8 contacts, such that the 9th contact will replace the 1st contact, the 10th will replace the 2nd, and so on.

### Example

## Installation

For this project and fututre C++ projects it is only required to have `clang` and/or `gcc`, which provide their respective compilers `clang++` and `g++`. It is also recommended to install the `valgrind` package on **Linux** for debugging purposes. Every exercise (unless specified otherwise) includes its own Makefile with the necessary instructions.

## Summary
For a first module, it was mostly easy, except for *ex02*, which was a bit tricky to understand at first.
